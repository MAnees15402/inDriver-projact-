# inDrive Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to analyze ride booking data from a ride-sharing platform (inDrive) to understand patterns in customer behavior, trip performance, and revenue. The insights derived from this analysis can support strategic decision-making, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction initiatives.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic, interactive dashboards
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV**: Data source in `.csv` format
- **DAX**: For creating calculated columns and measures

## Dataset Overview
- **File**: `Bookings-100000-Rows.csv`
- **Records**: 100,000+ ride bookings
- **Columns**: Includes fields like booking ID, customer ID, trip date, pickup and dropoff locations, distance, price, payment method, ride status, and customer ratings

## Dashboard Features & Analysis
### 1. Booking Trends
- Number of rides per day, week, and month
- Peak booking hours and days of the week
- Cancellations and completed trips breakdown

### 2. Revenue & Pricing Analysis
- Total revenue by month and by region
- Average ride fare over time
- Top-performing routes in terms of revenue

### 3. Customer Behavior
- Active vs. inactive users
- Frequency of repeat bookings
- Ratings distribution and customer satisfaction trends

### 4. Operational Insights
- Average ride distance and duration
- Common pickup and drop-off zones (mapped with visuals)
- Ride completion rate vs. cancellation rate

## Insights
- Bookings peak during weekday rush hours and weekend nights, indicating commuting and leisure patterns.
- A small number of routes generate a high percentage of revenue, suggesting areas to optimize marketing.
- The cancellation rate spikes during certain hours or due to specific payment methods.
- Repeat users show a higher average rating and booking frequency compared to new users.

## How to Use
1. Open `inDrive.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Review dashboard tabs for bookings, revenue, and customer behavior.
3. Use filters (by region, date, or ride status) to gain more targeted insights.

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time data integration from booking API
- Build predictive models for ride demand and customer churn
- Enhance geo-visualization using latitude and longitude data for mapping rides
